- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jrouzies-fr
- ðŸ‘€ Originally a System Administrator / Engineer, now specialized in Exchange Servers / O365, I learned on the fly .NET development thanks to my PowerShell scripting knowledge. I am far from a Senior or experienced developer (_as I can spend 2 months coding, then 2 months only doing admin_), I still know how to code C# WinForm apps, ASP.NET, Windows Services, using Entity Framewrok and SQL.
